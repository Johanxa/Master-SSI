##Cryptography##
**Cryptography project**
1. Implement RSA.
2. Implement a digital certificate.
3. Verify a certificate.
4. Encrypt and decrypt files.
5. Implement a ransomware scenario.
6. How to prevent this attack.

##Arithm√©tique modulaire
The objective of this project is to first explain the problem of implementing modular reductions, to present the various proposed algorithms, and to implement a general modular reduction algorithm while specifying its complexity.

##System Security
Our project involved delivering a presentation on NIST 800-123, elucidating its key aspects, and identifying two potential countermeasures ( Social Engineering, on MS  repository of default key that could lead to a vulnerability.)

##Introduction to cybersecurity
**Implementing 5 web vulnerabilities**: The purpose of this project was to create a vulnerable website and implement five vulnerabilities. 
This involved defining their origins, ways to patch them, and outlining each step of the process for both implementation and subsequent discovery.
